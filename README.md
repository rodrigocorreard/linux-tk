# Linux Tool Kit 

This project aims to simplify some repetitive tasks when reinstalling an operating system.
The project is developed using Tauri and Vuejs technologies. So far, the scripts have only been tested on Ubuntu 24.04, but theoretically, it can be used on any Debian-based distribution.
More package managers will be added soon so it can be used on other platforms.
